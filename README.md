## MVP: 
  1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  2. Styled using Flexbox or Grid.
  3. Use fetch to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
  4. Implement responsive design using at least one media query/breakpoint (i.e. desktop, tablet, mobile, etc).
  5. Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
  6. Deployed site on Github Pages.
  7. At least 30 commits in your project repository.
  8. A README.md file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i.

  * Build responsive website for searching adoptable pets
    * Add search filter and look through adoptable pets

## Post-MVP: 
  * Instead of populating all search results that fit criteria, create more of a Tinder set up - randomized pet within search criteria will display with bio details with ability to click through to official profile or "swipe" and move on to next pet
  * Touch event for swiping
